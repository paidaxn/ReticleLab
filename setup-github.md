# GitHub Setup Instructions for ReticleLab

## Option 1: Create via GitHub Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Create a new repository** with these settings:
   - Repository name: `ReticleLab`
   - Description: "Professional Valorant crosshair platform - Browse, copy, and customize elite crosshair configurations"
   - Public/Private: Choose based on your preference
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

3. **After creating, copy the repository URL** (it will look like: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ReticleLab.git`)

4. **Run these commands in your terminal**:
```bash
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ReticleLab.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you want to install GitHub CLI:

```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# After installation, authenticate
gh auth login

# Create repository and push
gh repo create ReticleLab --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Option 3: Using Git Commands Only

If you already have a GitHub repository created:

```bash
# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ReticleLab.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
